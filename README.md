# <Mod13-ORM-ECommerce>

## Description

This is a basic database and seed setup for an e-commerce website application. 

- I did this project to get better aquainted with back end and database work. 
- To test myself on Express Routes. 
- This helps to sorting through products and different categories by just id numbers. 
- I'm more comfortable with database work now. 

## Installation
Express, MySQL, Insomnia (or other test client).
